# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_AG
In the banking industry, detecting credit card fraud using machine learning is not just a trend; it is a necessity for banks, as they need to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning helps these institutions reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denial of legitimate transactions.
To perform this analysis, you need to compare the costs incurred before and after the model is deployed. Earlier, the bank paid the entire transaction amount to the customer for every fraudulent transaction which accounted for a heavy loss to the bank.

 Finex is a leading financial service provider based out of Florida, US. It offers a wide range of products and business services to customers through different channels, ranging from in-person banking and ATMs to online banking. Over the last few years, Finex has observed that a significantly large number of unauthorised transactions are being made, due to which the bank has been facing a huge revenue and profitability crisis. Many customers have been complaining about unauthorised transactions being made through their credit/debit cards. It has been reported that fraudsters use stolen/lost cards and hack private systems to access the personal and sensitive data of many cardholders. They also indulge in ATM skimming at various POS terminals such as gas stations, shopping malls, and ATMs that do not send alerts or do not have OTP systems through banks. Such fraudulent activities have been reported to happen during non-peak and odd hours of the day leaving no room for suspicion.

 

In most cases, customers get to know of such unauthorised transactions happening through their cards quite late as they are unaware of such ongoing credit card frauds or they do not monitor their bank account activities closely. This has led to late complaint registration with Finex and by the time the case is flagged fraudulent, the bank incurs heavy losses and ends up paying the lost amount to the cardholders.

 

Now, Finex is also not really equipped with the latest financial technologies, and it is becoming difficult for the bank to track these data breaches on time to prevent further losses. The Branch Manager is worried about the ongoing situation and wants to identify the possible root causes and action areas to come up with a long-term solution that would help the bank generate high revenue with minimal losses.

Now after the model has been deployed, the bank plans to provide a second layer of authentication for each of the transactions that the model predicts as fraudulent. If a payment gets flagged by the model, an SMS will be sent to the customer requesting them to call on a toll-free number to confirm the authenticity of the transaction. A customer experience executive will also be made available to respond to any queries if necessary. Developing this service would cost the bank $1.5 per fraudulent transaction.
